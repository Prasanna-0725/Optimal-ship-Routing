# Optimal-ship-Routing
Our Optimal Ship Routing engine solves a *multi-objective optimization* problem, designed to generate routes that are:

* *Fuelâ€‘efficient* â€” minimize fuel consumption by intelligently combining vessel speed, sea state, and ocean current data. This can lead to fuel savings of *up to \~25%*, depending on conditions and algorithms.
* *Timeâ€‘effective* â€” reduce voyage duration and meet ETA constraints while deliberately avoiding delays caused by adverse weather, congestion, or slowâ€‘steaming tradeoffs .
* *Safe and riskâ€‘aware* â€” avoid hazardous areas such as storms, rough seas, shallow zones, and restricted regions by embedding seakeeping and stability criteria into the route planning process. 
* *Environmentally responsible* â€” minimize COâ‚‚ and other emissions by optimizing speed and route selection in alignment with IMO decarbonization targets and sustainability frameworks.

ðŸ›  By balancing fuel use, voyage time, safety, and emissions, the system identifies Pareto-optimal paths tailored to different operational prioritiesâ€”making navigation smarter, safer, cost-efficient, and sustainable.
